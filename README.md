# The Classic Polymath by Kris Yotam

This project is based on my book *The Classic Polymath*. It forms part of my [Classical Education]() system, where the goal is to revive the age-old idea of the polymath—mastering multiple disciplines, including science, philosophy, arts, and mathematics. This book will act as a key resource for fostering interdisciplinary thinking and will later integrate with my [Reformed Education]() curriculum.
